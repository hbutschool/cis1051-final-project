# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Terraria Bullet Hell

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
Bullet hell game, but with terraria sprite, 3 boss, 10 hp player 3 lives, and maybe a system to kill the boss

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The program will be done in pygame, using turtle as a way to guide the boss (or if pygame got a better system). We will overlay the texture of the turtle with a Terraria sprite model. We will also try to get the hitbox to match best we can. Either will spam bullets everywhere or there will be a pattern to the bullet. Maybe there should be a prize for winning (or gg you won, and get gud if you lose), game shouldn't be hard to beat, you have a total of 30 hits before you die.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
Name: Tai Tran, Email: tuu79469@temple.edu, TA: Tomoya Kanno
Name: Henry Luong, Email: tut56598@temple.edu, TA: David Loder

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A play screen, players movement, hit detection, 2-3 boss with hit box.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Pattern bullets, a way to beat the boss through interaction, different phases.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Best outcome is to get everything done. Bullets, hitboxes, player interaction with the boss, boss movement, and all 3 boss are added.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
We are going to need to learn how to use pygame, probably just going to read documentation. Movement for the boss and hitbox interaction. Watch some game play video of Terraria to get some movement idea and improve on those movement. Watch videos of bullet hell games to get some idea on restriction to the player and interaction with the boss. Each one of us will probably work on a boss seperately and maybe the last one together.
